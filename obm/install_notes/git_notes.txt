# Organization Membership
#
- I added everyone to the obm-cugos-org owners list as wells as the cugos-obm-org-team (this includes the one repository)
- Everyone in owners has push, pull and admin rights
- To get into obm-cugos-org view just login into normal github account and click on 'Switch Context'
- You'll notice an obmgitadmin user. This is unneeded but whatevs.

# public keys and id_rsq.pub
#
- You can use your existing id_rsq.pub key from your normal github account to clone, push and pull changes to the repositories that we are all 'Team' members of in the organization
- Here is a link regarding setting up your public keys http://help.github.com/linux-key-setup/
